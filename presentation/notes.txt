Notes from Erin


* What is low conditional density means?

* Add a diagram with a river(blue line), flow-connected sensors
	- You can then point the two sensors and describe the lag time
	- Target variable - example (Turbidity or nitrate)
	- Predictors - other water-quality variables (conductivity, water-level)
	- flow-connected that means water flows from upstream to downstream
	- Say technical anomalies - If I say outliers then I mean technical anomalies
	- Remove outliers scores bubble (or put residuals/outlier scores)

* Slide-11 
	- Say gray is down and yellow up

* Slide-15
	- change contemporaneous to other water-quality variables
	- Say I model turbidity always with different sets of predictors
	- The models that includes AR terms are modeling temporal correlation

* Slide-16
	-  Start by saying that lag time between two sites differs at different times of year, 
	   or different systems, sizes of rivers. 

* Slide-18
	- Title for the slide
	- Cross correlation â€“ say why you expect CC to be positive.

* Slide-21
	- Discuss how's the threshold is determined

* Concluding slide
* How would you choose between GAM-down-AR and GAM-up-AR/GAM-up-down. This depends on their priorities
	- If you don't want to miss any outlier /very critical about outliers
	  maybe you want to take GAM-down-AR
	- In most cases, someone has to go to the sensor and inspect the sensor
	  causing outliers. In that case you might want a balance between 
	  FP and FN which you can go for the GAM-up-AR/GAM-up-down. Minimise the operational cost
	- Odd-water with multivariate approach might be better, but this is just the univariate approach
* Take away messages
	- Trade-off between FP and FN
	- Reduce operational cost
	- The method still can be used for single sensor
	
	- You can put low-cost sensors close together
* Thank you slide
